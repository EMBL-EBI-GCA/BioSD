BioSD
=====

A perl API for the BioSamples database

BioSD is a perl API for querying the BioSamples archive via the Rest interface.
BioSD can be called from within a perl script so that perl programmers have a
natural way of interacting with the archive, without needing to create url
queries or parse xml.  BioSD supports all functionality offered by the
BioSamples Rest interface, including searching for samples, searching for
groups, and reading sample properties and attributes.
